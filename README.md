## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 18.x)
- MySQL

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ironmandeveloper/Smart-Search-Algorithm-Raw.git
    cd Smart-Search-Algorithm-Raw
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Configure the database:

    Create a MySQL database and update the `config/config.json` file with your database credentials:

    ```json
    {
      "development": {
        "username": "your_username",
        "password": "your_password",
        "database": "smart_search_dev",

        "port":"3306",
        "dialect": "mysql"
      }
    }
    ```

4. Run the database migrations:

    ```bash
    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
    ```

5. Seed the database with initial data:

    ```bash
    npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
    ```
